 * DO NOT even try to understand what is going on here :-)
 * if you want something from this file, immadinatly ask me (@gucio321 on GH)
 * But for me or someone crazy who'd want to read this, here is a documentation:
 *
 * drawCommands _should_ self-implement drawCommand interface
 * it is factory-based type to draw chemical schemes
 *
 * drawLine - draw a line (angle 45Â°) in given direction
 * aromaticRing - draw a hexagon
 * add - add a drawCommand to the list of commands (drawCommands is a drawCommand as well ;-) )
 * move - move the cursor by given amount
 * ignore - ignores last offset (x/Y or both)
 * chemicalText - draws a text with chemical format (e.g. 2H_2_O should be drawn correctly)
